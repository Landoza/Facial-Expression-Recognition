Final submitted solution for Kaggle inclass competition for facial expression recognition (link: http://inclass.kaggle.com/c/facial-expression-prediction2/leaderboard). My team (Midnight Mercenary) achieves a recognition rate of 85.7% on Toronto Face Dataset, the highest ever in three years of student competition.
